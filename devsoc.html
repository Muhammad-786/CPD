                   To get extra help and gain more CPD hours I decided to join a society. So I joined the DevSoc society, DevSoc is a society of programmers and students from all years, it also has certified mentors which help you out. When I joined I noticed the members were quite friendly and helpful. <br><br>

                   They also had a lot of events going on such as, cryptography challenge, python workshops, mtm workshops and many more. I decided to do the cryptography challenge. <br><br>
                   
                   For the cryptography challenge, I had to find a secret password which was enctrypted in a different language and was divided in 3 parts.

                After I completed the cryptography challenge and the python workshops, I learned new things such as ciphers and that text can be crypted in different languages.<br><br> The python workshops also helped in having a better understanding about the language, as I was a beginner to the language. As I mentioned before I earned a total of 10 CPD hours from DevSoc. <br><br> After completing the cryptography challenge I gained a total of 10 CPD hours. I also had 4 hours for python workshops which were hosted by DevSoc, since the limit is 10 hours per activity I am not able to go over 10 hours.
