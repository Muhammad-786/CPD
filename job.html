                   Since I already had around 20 CPD hours, I wanted to push myself even more and achieve 30 CPD hours, so I decided to look for a part-time job. <br><br>

                   A friend of mine told me that boots was hiring part-time, so I decided to give them a call, after that I had an interview and got the job.<br><br>
                   
                   Since I could only get a max of 10 hours of CPD per activity, I did only Saturday shifts, which were 8 hours long. Plus I am a university student so it would have been harder to focus on studies if I worked more days.

               After I started working at Boots, I now have more working experience, know what the real industry actually looks like and what they expect from you. I also gained more confidence, working and communcation skills and made a lot of new friends.<br><br>As I mentioned before I gained a total of 10 CPD hours from my part-time job.

            My job was to pick and drop items from a location to a tote, and use a computer to send that tote away. The warehouse sells all kind of items, like electronics, cleaning products, beauty products etc.  <br><br>
            A Boots warehouse, is a big building which stores raw materials or products, so that it can sell them. As mentioned before the warehouse has all kind of items in it, such as electronics, cleaning products, beauty products, baby products, household items etc. <br> <br>
